Examples of time series ML in TensorFlow

After completing the Coursera course "Sequences, Time Series and Prediction", I was wondering how to extend my knowledge from univariate prediction to multivariate classification using sequence models. I searched the forum and saw that others had similar questions. Hence, I modified Week 4's optional exercise, which asks students to predict daily minimum temperature (see "S+P Week 4 Multivariate" notebook). I added a feature called "Warm" which is simply a binary classification whereby temperatures greater than 55 degrees fahrenheit are "Warm" and others are not (see "daily-min-temperatures_binary.csv").
